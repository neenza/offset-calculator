# Render Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### ✅ Code Preparation
- [ ] All code committed to GitHub repository
- [ ] `Dockerfile` created and tested locally
- [ ] `requirements.txt` updated with all dependencies
- [ ] Environment variables properly configured
- [ ] CORS settings updated for production

### ✅ Database Setup
- [ ] MongoDB Atlas cluster created
- [ ] Database user created with read/write permissions
- [ ] Network access configured (0.0.0.0/0 for Render)
- [ ] Connection string obtained
- [ ] Redis database planned (Render Redis or external)

### ✅ Security Setup
- [ ] Strong `SECRET_KEY` generated
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] No sensitive data in code repository
- [ ] Authentication endpoints tested

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Database Configuration
- [ ] MongoDB Atlas cluster is running
- [ ] Redis service is available
- [ ] Connection strings are ready

### 2. Render Setup
- [ ] Render account created
- [ ] GitHub repository connected
- [ ] Service type: Web Service
- [ ] Environment: Docker
- [ ] Dockerfile path: `./backend/Dockerfile`
- [ ] Root directory: `backend`

### 3. Environment Variables Setup
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://...
REDIS_URL=redis://...
SECRET_KEY=your-generated-secret
ALGORITHM=HS256
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30
SINGLE_DEVICE_LOGIN=true
SESSION_FINGERPRINTING=true
ENVIRONMENT=production
FRONTEND_URL=https://your-frontend-domain.com
```

### 4. Deployment Verification
- [ ] Service status is "Live"
- [ ] Health check endpoint responds: `/`
- [ ] API documentation accessible: `/docs`
- [ ] Authentication endpoints working
- [ ] Database connection successful
- [ ] Redis connection successful

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### Frontend Integration
- [ ] Update frontend API base URL
- [ ] Test authentication flow
- [ ] Verify CORS configuration
- [ ] Test all API endpoints

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Check Render logs for errors
- [ ] Monitor response times
- [ ] Set up alerts for downtime
- [ ] Document API endpoints for frontend team

### Security Verification
- [ ] HTTPS is working
- [ ] Authentication is enforced
- [ ] User data isolation is working
- [ ] Rate limiting is in place (if implemented)

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Failures
- Check `requirements.txt` for missing dependencies
- Verify Docker syntax
- Review build logs in Render dashboard

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify MongoDB connection string format
- Check MongoDB Atlas network access settings
- Ensure database user permissions are correct

### Authentication Problems
- Verify `SECRET_KEY` is set and strong
- Check Redis connection for session storage
- Review auth middleware configuration

### CORS Issues
- Update `FRONTEND_URL` environment variable
- Check allowed origins in main.py
- Verify frontend is making requests to correct URL

## Performance Optimization

### Before Going Live
- [ ] Database indexing implemented
- [ ] Query optimization completed
- [ ] Caching strategy implemented
- [ ] Rate limiting configured
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive

### Monitoring
- [ ] Set up logging
- [ ] Monitor database performance
- [ ] Track API response times
- [ ] Monitor memory usage

## Backup and Recovery

### Database Backups
- [ ] MongoDB Atlas automatic backups enabled
- [ ] Backup schedule configured
- [ ] Recovery process documented

### Code Backups
- [ ] Code in version control (GitHub)
- [ ] Deployment configuration saved
- [ ] Environment variables documented securely

## Scaling Considerations

### Current Limitations (Free Tier)
- 512MB RAM
- Service sleeps after 15 minutes inactivity
- 750 build hours per month

### When to Upgrade
- [ ] Consistent traffic requiring always-on service
- [ ] Need more memory or CPU
- [ ] Require custom domains
- [ ] Need advanced monitoring

## Final Checklist
- [ ] All environment variables set correctly
- [ ] Database connections tested
- [ ] API endpoints returning expected responses
- [ ] Frontend can connect to backend
- [ ] User authentication working
- [ ] Data isolation between users verified
- [ ] HTTPS working correctly
- [ ] Error handling graceful
- [ ] Logs are informative
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
